# Debunking Amazon DynamoDB Myths.

Welcome to this repository, this is the official github repository that will be used to share the examples shared in the twitch series "Debunking Amazon DynamoDB Myths".

This is the branch that covers the episode seven.

# Episode Seven - Myth #3: You canâ€™t implement atomic counters with Amazon DynamoDB.

In this episode we will be interviewing Chris Gillespie and Jason Hunter, since they have recently wrote a blog about how to [implement resource counters with Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implement-resource-counters-with-amazon-dynamodb/). At this point in the Series we are discussing how to implement certain functionalities that are often over-simplified, however when we need to think about scale and massive paralell computing there are some elements you need to consider.

Chris will walk us through seven approaches for managing counters.

1. [Atomic counters](./resource_counters/1_atomic_counter.py)
2. [Optimistic concurrency control](./resource_counters/2_occ.py)
3. [Optimistic concurrency control with history](./resource_counters/3_occ_with_history.py)
4. [Transaction with a client request token](./resource_counters/4_transaction.py)
5. [Transaction with a marker item](./resource_counters/5_transaction_with_marker.py)
6. [Counting with an item collection](./resource_counters/6_item_collection.py)
7. [Counting with a set](./resource_counters/7_with_a_set.py)
