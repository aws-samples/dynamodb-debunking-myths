# Debunking Amazon DynamoDB Myths.

Welcome to this repository, this is the official github repository that will be used to share the examples shared in the twitch series "Debunking Amazon DynamoDB Myths".

In this `main` branch you will find only this Readme.md file! For each new episode that have code available we will create a new branch. For example to find the code that was used during the second episode you will need to navigate to the [`episode-two-code`](https://github.com/aws-samples/dynamodb-debunking-myths/tree/episode-two-code) branch.
